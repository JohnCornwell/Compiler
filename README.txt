CS 442 John Cornwell

This compiler can:

**Process Integer Expressions**
-Integer literals and variables.
-Variables must be declared before they are used.
-Assign values to variables.
-Do arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, -(unary minus), and ^).
-Use relational operators (<, <=, ==, >=, >, and !).
-Use boolean operators (!, &&, and ||).
-All operators except ^ use the precedence and associativity rules of C. 

**Use Integer I/O**
-Read a comma-delimited list of variables.
-Print a comma-delimited list of expressions.
-Print a newline.
-Print a number of spaces equal to an input expression.

**Use Control Structures**
-If statements including optional else. !!Can also use as many else ifs as needed!!
-While loops
-For loops !!Same formatting as C syntax. Ex: for(i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1){}!!
-Use the C definition of true (non-zero) and false (zero).

**Use Arrays**
-Single dimension arrays whose size is determined at compile time.
-Uses C syntax for declaration and use.
-Subscripts can be either constants or variable expressions.

**Use Functions**
-Void and int functions.
-Value parameters.
-Use local variables.
-Use recursion.

**Use Booleans**
-Boolean literals and variables.
-Boolean assignment.
-Print the words true and false, and read booleans (non-zero for true and 0 for false).
-Variables must be declared before use.
-Boolean functions and parameters.
